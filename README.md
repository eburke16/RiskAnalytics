# Risk Analytics

Risk management has always been in the vanguard of data analytics because risk measurement is a critical element in calculating risk/return tradeoffs. This course examined both qualitative and quantitative analytical methods commonly used in risk management. Qualitative tools include impact/likelihood analysis; event and fault trees; threats, vulnerability, and consequences (TVC); and failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA).

A key lesson in risk management is that what gets measured gets managed. As a result, a major part of the course focused on quantitative tools, including modeling and stochastic simulations. I used the @Risk software to build realistic risk models with Monte Carlo Simulation, including one in assessing and mitigating project management risks. My paper, available in this repository, reviews the design of the model, analyzes and interprets its results, and provides suggestions for potential improvements in future iterations.
